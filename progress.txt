I'll go through the exercise requirements and mark each task as done or pending based on the current implementation:

TCP connection between server and multiple clients (relation of 1 to many)

Status: Done ✅
The current implementation uses clients []net.Conn and handles multiple client connections with goroutines.


A name requirement to the client

Status: Partially Done ⚠️
The code prompts for a username and stores it in the users map.
Need to add more robust username validation (e.g., non-empty, unique names).


Control connections quantity

Status: Pending ❌
No current implementation of limiting to 10 connections.
Need to add a check to prevent more than 10 clients from connecting.


Clients must be able to send messages to the chat

Status: Done ✅
The Handle function allows clients to send and receive messages.


Do not broadcast EMPTY messages from a client

Status: Pending ❌
Currently, no check for empty messages before broadcasting.


Messages identified by time and username

Status: Pending ❌
Need to add timestamp formatting to messages.
Current implementation only shows username.


Previous messages uploaded to new client

Status: Pending ❌
No current mechanism to store and replay previous chat history.


Client join notification

Status: Partially Done ⚠️
Notifies other clients when a user joins.
Could improve the notification format.


Client exit notification

Status: Partially Done ⚠️
Notifies other clients when a user disconnects.
Could improve the notification format.


All clients receive messages

Status: Done ✅
Broadcast mechanism is implemented.


Clients remain connected if one leaves

Status: Done ✅
Current implementation maintains other client connections.


Default port 8989, with usage message for other ports

Status: Pending ❌
No command-line argument handling for port specification.
No usage message implementation.



Additional Observations:

Error handling could be improved
No unit tests have been implemented
Mutex usage is good, but could be optimized
Need to implement a more robust connection management system

To fully meet the exercise requirements, you'll need to:

Implement connection limit (max 10 clients)
Add timestamp to messages
Create a message history mechanism
Add command-line port handling
Implement more robust error handling
Create empty message filtering
Add unit tests
